For part 2 i have now changed to .net framework 4.8
All arrays have been changed into lists(genric) allowing users to add as many recipe objects as they please
The list for recipes has been put in its own class with a single responibility and made static
The alert is used through a delegate and thats the only subscriber becasue no other methods need to run for 300+ calories
The alert for the calories uses messagebox.show method so its a popup
There is a use of colour throughout the program like red warnings
Recipes are now displayed in order using lambda/linq expressions
Then i retrive the object from the actual list and excecute code
The code itself is type safe and uses try catch for most methods, I have used string formating for my to list
The calorie information was ai generated because it produced high quality paragraphs
I have added comments in the code


The main probelm i had was with the unit testing it was not finding my reference to my project, I have done unit testing before and havent come accross this issue
I installed frameworks and made sure i was referncing my project while using a .net framwork type of unit test which was targetting the right framework
